Favicon Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the actual favicon image file.
When implementing the real portfolio, replace "assets/favicon.png" with a real favicon image.

For favicon creation, consider:
1. Create a square logo (at least 512x512 pixels)
2. Generate favicon in multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 96x96, etc.)
3. Use tools like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net

For best practices:
- Use a PNG format for transparency
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use the same color scheme as your portfolio

For now, this text file serves as a reminder to add the actual favicon before deploying the portfolio.
